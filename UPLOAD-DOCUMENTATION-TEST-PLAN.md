# Upload Documentation Test Plan

## Objective
To verify that the fixed implementation correctly handles file uploads and displays the extracted data from the assistant.

## Test Cases

### 1. File Upload Functionality
- **Test Case 1.1**: Upload a PDF file
  - Steps:
    1. Click on the upload area or drag and drop a PDF file
    2. Verify the file is displayed in the selected file area
    3. Click "Extract Information"
    4. Verify the processing indicator appears
    5. Verify the extracted information is displayed in the results area

- **Test Case 1.2**: Upload a DOCX file
  - Steps:
    1. Click on the upload area or drag and drop a DOCX file
    2. Verify the file is displayed in the selected file area
    3. Click "Extract Information"
    4. Verify the processing indicator appears
    5. Verify the extracted information is displayed in the results area

- **Test Case 1.3**: Upload an image file (JPG/PNG)
  - Steps:
    1. Click on the upload area or drag and drop an image file
    2. Verify the file is displayed in the selected file area
    3. Click "Extract Information"
    4. Verify the processing indicator appears
    5. Verify the extracted information is displayed in the results area

- **Test Case 1.4**: Upload a text file
  - Steps:
    1. Click on the upload area or drag and drop a text file
    2. Verify the file is displayed in the selected file area
    3. Click "Extract Information"
    4. Verify the processing indicator appears
    5. Verify the extracted information is displayed in the results area

### 2. Error Handling
- **Test Case 2.1**: Upload an invalid file type
  - Steps:
    1. Try to upload a file with an unsupported extension (e.g., .exe)
    2. Verify an error message is displayed
    3. Verify the file is not added to the selected file area

- **Test Case 2.2**: Upload a file that exceeds the size limit
  - Steps:
    1. Try to upload a file larger than 10MB
    2. Verify an error message is displayed
    3. Verify the file is not added to the selected file area

- **Test Case 2.3**: Server error handling
  - Steps:
    1. Simulate a server error (e.g., by modifying the server endpoint)
    2. Try to upload a valid file
    3. Verify an error message is displayed
    4. Verify the processing indicator is hidden

### 3. UI Functionality
- **Test Case 3.1**: Cancel upload
  - Steps:
    1. Select a file
    2. Click "Cancel"
    3. Verify the file is removed from the selected file area
    4. Verify no processing occurs

- **Test Case 3.2**: Remove selected file
  - Steps:
    1. Select a file
    2. Click the "X" button on the file item
    3. Verify the file is removed from the selected file area

- **Test Case 3.3**: Upload another file
  - Steps:
    1. Upload a file and wait for processing to complete
    2. Click "Upload Another File"
    3. Verify the file selection area is shown again
    4. Verify the previous results are cleared

### 4. Streaming Response
- **Test Case 4.1**: Verify streaming response
  - Steps:
    1. Upload a file that will generate a long response
    2. Observe the results area during processing
    3. Verify the response appears incrementally (streaming)
    4. Verify the complete response is displayed correctly

- **Test Case 4.2**: Verify response formatting
  - Steps:
    1. Upload a file
    2. Wait for the response to complete
    3. Verify the response is properly formatted (e.g., markdown is rendered correctly)

## Expected Results
1. All file types (PDF, DOCX, images, text) should be processed correctly
2. Extracted information should be displayed in the results area
3. The response should stream in real-time
4. Error cases should be handled gracefully with appropriate error messages
5. UI controls should work as expected

## Success Criteria
The implementation is considered successful if:
1. All test cases pass
2. The extracted data is displayed from the assistant as expected
3. The streaming response works correctly
4. No errors occur in the browser console during normal operation
