# Upload Documentation Solution Summary

## Problem Statement
The `UploadDocumentation.tsx` component was not correctly handling the streaming response from the server. When a request was sent to the 'apps/server/src/app/ai/extract/route.ts', it returned a text stream response using `toTextStreamResponse()`, but the client component was not handling this response correctly. As a result, the extracted data was not being displayed from the assistant as expected.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a conflict in how the client component was handling the streaming response:

1. The component was using the `useChat` hook with `DefaultChatTransport` to handle streaming responses
2. It was also making a direct `fetch` request in the `handleUpload` function that bypassed the hook's streaming handling
3. The server was returning a text stream (`result.toTextStreamResponse()`), but the client was configured to use the default transport protocol

## Solution Design
Based on the Vercel AI SDK documentation, the solution was to:

1. Replace `DefaultChatTransport` with `TextStreamChatTransport` since the server is returning a text stream
2. Remove the direct `fetch` request in `handleUpload`
3. Use the `sendMessage` function from `useChat` to send the file
4. Let the `useChat` hook handle the streaming response automatically

## Implementation Details

### Changes to UploadDocumentation.tsx

1. **Import Update**:
   ```typescript
   import { TextStreamChatTransport } from "ai";
   ```

2. **Transport Configuration Update**:
   ```typescript
   const { messages, setMessages, sendMessage } = useChat({
     transport: new TextStreamChatTransport({
       api: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL}/ai/extract`,
     }),
     onFinish: (message) => {
       setIsUploading(false);
       if (onUploadComplete) {
         onUploadComplete(message);
       }
     },
     onError: (error) => {
       setIsUploading(false);
       setError(error.message || "Failed to process document");
     },
   });
   ```

3. **handleUpload Function Update**:
   ```typescript
   const handleUpload = async () => {
     if (files.length === 0) {
       setError("Please select a file to upload");
       return;
     }

     setIsUploading(true);
     setError(null);
     
     // Clear previous messages
     setMessages([]);
     
     // Create a custom message with file data
     const file = files[0];
     
     try {
       // Send the file using sendMessage
       await sendMessage({
         role: "user",
         parts: [
           {
             type: "file",
             data: file,
             mimeType: file.type,
             filename: file.name,
           },
           {
             type: "text",
             text: "Please extract information from this document relevant to Vietnamese birth registration.",
           },
         ],
       });
     } catch (error) {
       setIsUploading(false);
       setError(error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Failed to upload file");
     }
   };
   ```

### Alternative Server-Side Modification (If Needed)
If the client-side changes don't work as expected, the server route could be modified to return a UI message stream instead of a text stream:

```typescript
// Change this:
return result.toTextStreamResponse();

// To this:
return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
```

And then keep using `DefaultChatTransport` on the client side.

## Expected Outcome
After implementing these changes:
1. The file upload will be properly handled through the `useChat` hook
2. The streaming response from the server will be correctly processed and displayed
3. The extracted data will be displayed from the assistant as expected
4. The UI will show the response streaming in real-time

## Testing Plan
A comprehensive test plan has been created in `UPLOAD-DOCUMENTATION-TEST-PLAN.md` to verify:
1. File upload functionality for all supported file types
2. Error handling for invalid files and server errors
3. UI functionality (cancel, remove, upload another file)
4. Streaming response behavior and formatting

## Files Created
1. `UPLOAD-DOCUMENTATION-FIX-PLAN.md` - Detailed implementation plan
2. `UPLOAD-DOCUMENTATION-TEST-PLAN.md` - Comprehensive test plan
3. `UPLOAD-DOCUMENTATION-SOLUTION-SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps
1. Switch to Code mode to implement the changes outlined in the fix plan
2. Run the test cases to verify the implementation works correctly
3. Make any necessary adjustments based on test results
4. Deploy the fixed implementation
